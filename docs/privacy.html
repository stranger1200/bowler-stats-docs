      <h2>3. How Your Data is Used</h2>
      <p>Your data is used exclusively to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver core features, such as displaying Clash Royale stats.</li>
        <li>Personalise your experience through custom colours and achievements.</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supercell:</strong> The bot transmits your Player Tag to the official Supercell API to retrieve public game data. It never asks for, stores, or accesses your Supercell login credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Sales:</strong> The bot does not sell, rent, or trade your data. Your information is never shared with advertisers or third-party brokers.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Necessity:</strong> Data may be disclosed only if required by law or in response to a valid request by public authorities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Your Rights & Data Control</h2>
      <p>You have full control over your information. You can manage your data directly through the bot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>View Your Data:</strong> Use <code>/data view</code> to see exactly what information the bot has stored associated with your Discord account.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete Your Data:</strong> Use <code>/data delete</code> to permanently remove your saved player tags, custom settings, and achievements from its database.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">Note: Deletion is irreversible. If you use the bot again, a new, blank profile will be created.</p>
      <p>If the bot is removed from a Discord server, all data specific to that server (Guild ID and configurations) is automatically purged from its systems.</p>
      <p>To exercise your right to access or for any manual data enquiries that cannot be resolved via commands, please contact me via the support server.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>I may update this policy periodically. Significant changes will be announced in my official Discord server. By continuing to use Bowler Stats, you automatically agree to the updated privacy policy.</p>
